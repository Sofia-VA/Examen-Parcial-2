        There are many fans who complain about All is Hell that Ends Well because it has dubstep. I am glad it has dubstep! Not because I like dubstep per se, but because Thomas was doing something different and new in his music which is one thing I respect about his compositions. Thomas especially, but also Nick, will not be fit into little boxes. They don't stay within the genre boundaries. They don't keep certain instruments separate because they don't go together (I'm thinking of Stallion from Vanquish where Thomas mixes piano, electric guitar, and organ! Crazy but it works!). They try new and weird things, they push the boundaries. Now look at the awesome results! Not all of the pieces work perfectly but that's okay.

          Recently discovered this CD by chance on Pandora while listening to Movie Soundtracks. The song being played was 'Blackheart' and instantly I had too know who this artist was. Needless to say I immediately got this CD after listening to the sample tracks. Blackheart happens to be my favorite followed by Winterspell, but I enjoyed all the tracks. I am now a devoted Epic Music fan and have already ordered CD's by Immediate, Audiomachine, Future World Music and I'm sure others to follow. Excellent CD and superb genre! LOVE IT!! Now why couldn't I have found this music sooner? Better late than never. Naturally I will get more TSFH!!

            If you're a fan of orchestral action-adventure movie soundtracks, this should be an excellent addition to your collection. Two Steps From Hell specializes in the increasingly popular genre known as "Trailer Music"; compositions that are clearly in the style of action-adventure symphonic scores, but which are clearly not from movies you've ever seen. Sometimes they end up being used with movie trailers, which is a welcome departure from the long-standing tradition of using bits of earlier movies' soundtracks. I use my collection of these pieces as my "stay awake on the road" playlist, and there are lots of them; look for Immediate Music to find another good bunch. By the way, I have noted in the past that pressings of the CDs from Two Steps From Hell tend to be short, and sell out quickly; grab it while it's in stock.
