        “Lone Digger” and “Tattoos” were the two songs performed on Jools Holland that immediately snagged me. This is electro-swing at its finest, mixing piano, synths, stand-up bass, archtop guitar, bari sax, clarinet, drums, a couple Korg Kaoses, flapper-era dancing, and a singer whose stage moves resemble a Muppet on steroids. On Robot, this Parisian band’s third, the changes come fast and the musicians are tight, freeing front-person Zoé Colotis to deliver the perfect stew of sneers, smiles, and wild abandon. Caravan Palace is a ‘30s speakeasy pushed through a wormhole into a rave reverberating directly beneath the Eiffel Tower, as the ghosts of Django Reinhardt and Cab Calloway clap along.

          This album is fantastic. Every song on it has a singular personality. This time, Caravan Palace have downplayed some of their swing roots (They aren't gone, they just aren't always the feature) and brought forth come hip hop elements. The addition of the Bari Sax to the mix was terrific. The Ends with a quasi-spiritual "Lay Down" which I have to listen to on repeat always. I'm too lazy of a reviewer for the quality of this album.

            Caravan Palace are a real band, not just a DJ/MC set up. This album is not as anachronistically quirky as their previous efforts, but still a solid set of electroswing tunes. Very danceable and hard swingin' if not as texturally intricate as Panic or old school funky as their debut. They seem to be charting some new territory here but I'm not sure what it is just yet. If you get to see these folks live DON'T MISS THE CHANCE. They really kicked out Le Jazz Techno HOT on their last North American Tour. All of their music is inspiring ad craftsmanlike and you can't really go wrong with any of their discography.
