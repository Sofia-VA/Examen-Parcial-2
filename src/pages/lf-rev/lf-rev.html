        Absolutely breathtaking. I don't even buy CDs hardly anymore except for good artists. A friend had me listen to the title track and I was already headed straight to Amazon to see if I could find it. I dare you to get through that first track without feeling compelled to listen to the rest of the album. The vocalist, Paint's, range is good and that plus the musical arrangements of each song... it's just amazing. If you're looking for a new favourite musical thing, this is it.

          A very remarkable adventure in orchastra rock. If you think you have heard every way rock can be written you haven't. Les Friction is nothing like you have ever heard. Listening in headphones sends you on a journey that you are, by the end,wanting more. If "Queen" or the "Beatles" had continued their musical journeys they would at some point arrived where Les Friction is on this cd. The recording is amazing...the louder the better!

        <ion-card-content> <p ALIGN="justify">Is les friction the best CD's ever ?
            It is, that is to say that Les friction is one of the best compositions if all times, in my opinion ( and that is all this is) Les friction is great because it is not like anything you have heard before, I find that almost every song has a dark feel and that is a good thing ( I like music with a dark feel to it ) and the songs that don't feel dark "Sunday" are very good in there own way.
         </p><p ALIGN="justify"> My favorite tracks ( not that I can really choose ) are " Louder than words" "world on fire" "Sunday" and "Come back to me" Louder than words starts of on a strange low note but by the end you are on the edge of your seat wanting more, World on fire is sort of the same way in that the build up to the end of the song is done so perfectly that you are sad but glad when the last note fades away, on the other hand Sunday has a more happy powerful feel to it, Come back to me is the last song on the CD and what a great song to end with, it starts off slow but the ending is so full of power and emotion that you will be left with your mouth hanging open for days wanting more :)
            In the end Les friction is a great addition to anyone's non mainstream music collection.
          </p><p ALIGN="justify">On a side note if you buy the album digitally you get all the instrumentals of the songs that you don't get with the CD just thought I would let you know :)
            I can't wait for there next CD but until then I will keep listing to this masterpiece.
